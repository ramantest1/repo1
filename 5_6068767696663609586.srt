00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:37,166
Go get her!

350
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,250
[intense dramatic music playing]

351
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:42,125
[sirens wailing]

352
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,375
[Palermo] I'm sorry.

353
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,583
I'm personally responsible
for all this shit.

354
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:04,958
I didn't realize the amount of pain
I'd cause, and I'm very sorry.

355
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,791
What do you know about pain, Palermo?

356
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:15,375
Pain is like a loan.

357
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:22,541
And no matter what you do,
you can never pay back the debt.

358
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:25,708
I can handle pain.

359
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,541
Lots of pain.

360
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:30,166
Oh, yeah?

361
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,583
Even the pain you're feeling right now?

362
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,458
This one's different, right?

363
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,958
I saw it in your eyes.

364
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,208
I saw it, and it reminds me of myself.

365
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:48,750
[Palermo] <i>You have no idea...</i>

366
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:52,708
<i>where the pain will take you, my friend.</i>

367
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,166
Get out of it while you can.

368
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,708
Otherwise, you could end up

369
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:03,750
becoming a piece of shit like me.

370
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:06,250
<i>A miserable monster.</i>

371
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:09,416
A guy who ruins everything he touches.

372
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,541
[screams]

373
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:13,416
Someone who flirted with death for years.

374
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:20,583
Once you're there, you can't get out.
You can never get out.

375
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:23,041
Look, brother...

376
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:27,041
because of all that bullshit
boom, boom,<i> ciao,</i>

377
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,208
I treated you like trash.

378
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:32,375
I wasn't brave. I couldn't be.
I didn't have the strength.

379
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,333
But I'm telling you, I'm here with you.
You're not alone.

380
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:37,875
I know.

381
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:40,458
I've known that from the beginning.

382
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,833
I know who you are.

383
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:48,458
My name is Martín Berrote.

384
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:52,208
I was born in Buenos Aires,

385
00:22:53,666 --> 00:22:55,416
but I live in Palermo, Sicily.

386
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,916
And I am going
to get you out of here alive,

387
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,666
even if I have to give my own life.

388
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:02,750
My name is Mirko Dragic.

389
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:05,291
I'm from Belgrade.

390
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:08,125
I lost Oslo at the Royal Mint of Spain,

391
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:09,791
and I lost Nairobi.

392
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:13,291
And I'm not gonna lose anyone else.

393
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:17,250
Not even you, Martín Berrote.

394
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:31,583
NATIONAL COURT
09:34 HOURS

395
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:34,625
[Professor] <i>Lisbon is going to testify
in the Supreme Court.</i>

396
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:37,041
<i>She'll earn the judge's trust,
giving them information,</i>

397
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:39,000
<i>cooperating and being reliable.</i>

398
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:41,916
<i>She'll give every little detail
about the heist because all of this...</i>

399
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:44,541
is part of plan Paris.

400
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:47,000
What is plan Paris?

401
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:53,166
A rescue plan
in case one of us gets caught.

402
00:23:58,375 --> 00:23:59,625
And why Paris?

403
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:05,000
Well, it's...

404
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:06,916
It's the city of freedom.

405
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,500
[Lisbon] Mm.

406
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:13,291
And of love.

407
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:18,166
Who hasn't walked around Paris in love?
Right, boys?

408
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,291
[all chuckle]

409
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,458
What will Lisbon tell the judge?

410
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:25,333
The truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth.

411
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:27,916
And in fact, she'll start with love.

412
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:31,791
[judge] How did you reconnect after
the first heist with Sergio Marquina?

413
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:32,875
How was it arranged?

414
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:36,041
I met the Professor
one year after they escaped

415
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:37,833
<i>in Palawan, Philippines.</i>

416
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:39,750
<i>He left a puzzle with coordinates.</i>

417
00:24:40,458 --> 00:24:42,666
He doesn't look like it,
but he's a romantic.

418
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,708
She'll tell them everything.

419
00:24:44,791 --> 00:24:48,416
Everything! Where we live, how often we've
had to move, how we move.

420
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,208
After about an hour, an hour and a half,

421
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:51,916
she'll start to tell them the plan.

422
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,083
[Darko] The plan?

423
00:24:53,166 --> 00:24:54,926
- She can't tell them.
- [Professor] She can.

424
00:24:54,958 --> 00:24:58,291
Truth is the basis of any relationship,
and that's how she'll earn it.

425
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:01,625
The plan is to steal 90 tons of gold
from the national reserve,

426
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,958
and what we're doing now is melting it.

427
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,583
You're melting the gold in the bank?

428
00:25:06,666 --> 00:25:09,791
As of now, they've melted about 50 tons.

429
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:13,041
We're using industrial furnaces
made by a company called Harmand.

430
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:14,125
Harmand.

431
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:15,833
German. They're the best.

432
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:18,458
Benjamín, how are we doing?

433
00:25:18,541 --> 00:25:20,125
Seven and a half meters!

434
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:21,333
We need to go faster.

435
00:25:21,416 --> 00:25:22,625
Go faster! Go faster!

436
00:25:23,958 --> 00:25:25,958
We'll give them every single detail.

437
00:25:26,583 --> 00:25:28,250
They reach 2,300 degrees.

438
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:31,250
- Gold melts at 1,064.
- [Professor] <i>We'll overwhelm them</i>

439
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:34,166
with so many technicalities
that their poor brains

440
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:36,291
won't be able to process
that much information.

441
00:25:36,375 --> 00:25:38,083
We knew that the vault would flood

442
00:25:38,166 --> 00:25:41,166
with a water flow
of 7,500 liters per minute.

443
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,125
That information is very detailed.

444
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,875
And we're doing it so...

445
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:47,291
- they get tired?
- Exactly.

446
00:25:47,375 --> 00:25:49,583
The biggest challenge
was the interconnection chamber.

447
00:25:49,666 --> 00:25:51,500
Could I have a pen and paper?

448
00:25:51,916 --> 00:25:54,291
- Let's get you tired first.
- [both laugh]

449
00:25:57,916 --> 00:25:59,833
- Meters?
- Nine meters!

450
00:25:59,916 --> 00:26:00,750
Go faster.

451
00:26:00,833 --> 00:26:02,541
[Lisbon] <i>The door to the vault,</i>

452
00:26:02,625 --> 00:26:03,875
fourteen tons of steel,

453
00:26:03,958 --> 00:26:07,416
we had to drill through it in just a few
minutes. A perfect circle with a radius...

454
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,500
The bathyscaphe floods...
That's how the divers...

455
00:26:09,583 --> 00:26:11,250
We weld the interconnection chamber...

456
00:26:11,333 --> 00:26:12,809
There's a balance in pressure...
To compensate...

457
00:26:12,833 --> 00:26:14,583
Twenty three hundred degrees Celsius...

458
00:26:14,666 --> 00:26:16,291
And it comes out the other side.

459
00:26:21,583 --> 00:26:23,916
Can we get some dinner in here, please?

460
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:30,500
[Tokyo] <i>They say pregnant women
have a sharper sense of smell.</i>

461
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:35,083
<i>The Professor hadn't anticipated
Sierra would have that superpower.</i>

462
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:37,958
<i>It was the first time
someone was tracking his scent</i>

463
00:26:38,041 --> 00:26:39,291
<i>without him realizing it.</i>

464
00:26:42,958 --> 00:26:45,375
<i>Antoñanzas's wife
hadn't seen the news yet.</i>

465
00:26:47,541 --> 00:26:49,875
- [woman] Marisa?
- [Tokyo] <i>Sierra got all the information</i>

466
00:26:49,958 --> 00:26:51,708
<i>she needed in under three minutes.</i>

467
00:26:51,791 --> 00:26:53,708
I work with Benito.
I don't know if you know me.

468
00:26:53,791 --> 00:26:54,791
I know you.

469
00:26:56,166 --> 00:26:57,666
Okay, how do I say this?

470
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:00,625
I've just been feeling
like Benito hasn't...

471
00:27:01,041 --> 00:27:02,375
been himself these days...

472
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:04,708
[Tokyo]
<i>Antoñanzas was acting nervous at home,</i>

473
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:07,541
<i>and then he was found in the pool

474
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:09,000
<i>in the middle of the night.</i>

475
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:11,458
<i>And to top it off,</i>

476
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:13,125
<i>he was wasted.</i>

477
00:27:13,208 --> 00:27:15,125
[crowd shouting]

478
00:27:16,666 --> 00:27:20,458
[man] <i>Colonel, it looks like Alicia Sierra
isn't home. We can't find her.</i>

479
00:27:20,791 --> 00:27:21,958
[Tamayo] Fucking bitch!

480
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:26,416
Attention, all units. Orders are out for
the search and capture of Alicia Sierra.

[siren wails]

482
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,166
[man] It doesn't matter who you are.
I can't give you the videos.

483
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,250
I need authorization from a judge,

484
00:27:33,958 --> 00:27:36,125
or at least the president
of the community.

485
00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:39,000
Wait, wait a second. Someone's calling me.

486
00:27:40,208 --> 00:27:42,708
Look at that.
The president of the community.

487
00:27:43,625 --> 00:27:45,291
How are you doing, Mr. President?

488
00:27:45,375 --> 00:27:47,333
[sirens wail]

489
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,500
That's great. Thank you so much.

490
00:27:52,625 --> 00:27:53,625
He says yes.

491
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:58,000
He says give me the tapes,
the ones from the entrance,

492
00:27:58,083 --> 00:28:00,291
the pool, parking lot, street.

493
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,750
Do it.

494
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,875
Listen, Amanda. [sniffs]

495
00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:21,291
[sighs] Shit. What you said earlier...

496
00:28:22,041 --> 00:28:24,875
All those fake,
unfounded accusations about me, you know?

497
00:28:24,958 --> 00:28:26,958
I don't wanna hear you.
I don't want you near me.

498
00:28:27,041 --> 00:28:28,500
- Come on...
- Didn't you hear her?

499
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:30,041
Leave her alone, Mr. Arturo.

500
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,166
Don't force me to take you out
because I will.

501
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,416
What are you doing?

502
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,833
Everyone, shut up now!

503
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:41,875
Listen, you scumbag.

504
00:28:42,541 --> 00:28:44,791
- You disgust me.
- You're calling me a scumbag?

505
00:28:44,875 --> 00:28:45,958
You?

506
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:50,291
A banker.
A puppet of the system and capitalism.

507
00:28:50,708 --> 00:28:53,250
You're gonna try and talk to me
about ethics?

508
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:57,083
You didn't even have enough balls
to stand up for your employees. Scumbag!

509
00:28:57,166 --> 00:28:58,708
[Matías] I said shut up now!

510
00:28:58,791 --> 00:29:00,416
[both grunt]

511
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,500
[Arturo] On the ground!

512
00:29:01,958 --> 00:29:03,791
Hands where I can see them,
behind your head!

513
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,500
Come on! What are you gonna do?

514
00:29:05,583 --> 00:29:06,666
You get over there!

515
00:29:07,583 --> 00:29:09,083
Come on. Everyone up.

516
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:10,926
I'm gonna get you all out of here,
I promise.

517
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,208
Everyone!

518
00:29:12,666 --> 00:29:14,851
See, that's the difference
between you and me, Governor.

519
00:29:14,875 --> 00:29:18,250
I came here to save all these people.
To be a hero!

520
00:29:18,833 --> 00:29:22,875
In the meantime, you can just stay
over there and piss your pants in fear,

521
00:29:22,958 --> 00:29:25,250
- Mr. Governor.
- [Julia] Arturo!

522
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:26,375
[hostages gasp]

523
00:29:26,458 --> 00:29:31,541
You're gonna put that G36 on the floor
in approximately three seconds

524
00:29:31,625 --> 00:29:33,375
because If you don't, you're a dead man.

525
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:38,541
Who do you think are you,
if you don't mind me asking.

526
00:29:38,958 --> 00:29:41,625
Manila. Undercover agent for the gang.

527
00:29:42,041 --> 00:29:44,583
Well, listen, Manila.

528
00:29:44,666 --> 00:29:46,416
I don't believe that bullshit.

529
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,000
Besides, that gun's fake,
like the ones they gave us before.

530
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:50,166
You're not fooling me.

531
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:54,041
You have two seconds left.
Put the gun on the floor

532
00:29:54,541 --> 00:29:56,583
and pray it's not true you raped Amanda.

533
00:29:56,666 --> 00:29:59,746
You're really getting on my nerves, honey.
I'm almost running out of patience.

534
00:29:59,791 --> 00:30:01,791
- One!
- [hostages clamoring]

535
00:30:02,416 --> 00:30:04,125
[Arturo screaming]

536
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,500
[Arturo] I didn't rape her! [crying]

537
00:30:08,583 --> 00:30:11,000
I only gave her some pills
for the anxiety.

538
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:12,958
I'm bleeding to death!

539
00:30:13,041 --> 00:30:14,625
I'm gonna die!

540
00:30:14,708 --> 00:30:17,041
[Governor] You're not gonna die.
It's just a surface wound.

541
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:18,625
It didn't hit any arteries,

542
00:30:18,708 --> 00:30:20,541
or anything important.

543
00:30:20,625 --> 00:30:24,666
Arturo, consider yourself under arrest,
accused of rape.

544
00:30:25,083 --> 00:30:26,083
And...

545
00:30:27,916 --> 00:30:29,125
I just remembered.

546
00:30:29,916 --> 00:30:33,708
You offered me some pills too, didn't you?
You piece of shit.

547
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,541
[Tokyo] <i>In the bank,
no one slept that night.</i>

548
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,125
<i>In the meantime, outside,</i>

549
00:30:42,125 --> 00:30:44,375
<i>our biggest enemy was wide awake.</i>

550
00:30:47,625 --> 00:30:51,958
<i>First, Sierra saw Antoñanzas fly
then crash into the diving board.</i>

551
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,375
<i>A few seconds later,
the Professor and Marseille appeared.</i>

552
00:30:59,666 --> 00:31:01,250
<i>It was 3:11 in the morning.</i>

553
00:31:09,625 --> 00:31:10,625
<i>Minutes later,</i>

554
00:31:11,916 --> 00:31:13,250
<i>she had their license plate.</i>

555
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:16,625
[line ringing]

556
00:31:18,708 --> 00:31:20,375
Hey. What's up, sweetheart?

557
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:23,083
[man]<i> Uh, for fuck's sake, Alicia.
What the fuck?</i>

558
00:31:23,166 --> 00:31:24,166
Relax.

559
00:31:24,541 --> 00:31:27,333
I have a license plate
from a car that drove on the M-30

560
00:31:27,416 --> 00:31:29,250
at three in the morning on April 7th.

561
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:30,791
I need to know where it went.

562
00:31:30,875 --> 00:31:33,541
<i>Alicia, the police are after you.
I can't do it. It's too risky.</i>

563
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:36,041
How many times
have I taken risks for you, Raúl?

564
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:38,416
Do you remember last time?

565
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,583
Cut the bullshit.

566
00:31:47,875 --> 00:31:48,708
Meters?

567
00:31:48,791 --> 00:31:50,000
Nine and a half!

568
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,416
Lisbon's mission...

569
00:31:53,291 --> 00:31:56,083
is to give us the time that we will need.

570
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:57,166
Look...

571
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,708
An average person can concentrate
for about 50 minutes.

572
00:32:00,791 --> 00:32:03,583
But no matter how important
the information is,

573
00:32:03,666 --> 00:32:06,375
there always comes a point
when the brain gets too exhausted.

574
00:32:07,291 --> 00:32:10,250
And all that's left to do
is come back the next day.

575
00:32:10,666 --> 00:32:13,000
[Lisbon] Do you know the only way
to cut metal underwater?

576
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:15,541
Have you ever heard about
underwater welding?

577
00:32:16,166 --> 00:32:18,375
Because down there,
we cut metal with fire.

578
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:20,000
Fire? Underwater?

579
00:32:20,083 --> 00:32:22,833
- Benjamín, how are we doing?
- Ten meters!

580
00:32:22,916 --> 00:32:24,333
We need to go faster!

581
00:32:24,416 --> 00:32:25,708
Go faster! Go faster!

582
00:32:25,791 --> 00:32:28,708
Again, fire underwater
to get to the State secrets,

583
00:32:28,791 --> 00:32:31,208
which are key for negotiation,
but it didn't work out.

584
00:32:31,708 --> 00:32:34,541
- So we had to use the dolphin.
- Wait. A dolphin?

585
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:36,083
Ten and a half.

586
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:41,625
Flipper is the code name we assigned
to the governor of the Bank of Spain.

587
00:32:41,708 --> 00:32:44,916
It was the fastest way of getting
hold of the secrets for negotiation.

588
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:46,916
That's an offense of coercion.

589
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,583
- I know.
- And it's also a disclosure of secrets.

590
00:32:49,666 --> 00:32:51,625
We sent all the secrets
to an external server.

591
00:32:52,041 --> 00:32:53,321
If I could get the pencil again,

592
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:55,625
I'll draw a diagram
of how the computer structure works.

593
00:32:57,083 --> 00:32:58,875
It's almost one in the morning.

594
00:32:59,291 --> 00:33:01,666
Maybe a recess would be a good idea,

595
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:05,416
if the prosecution
and the defense are in favor of it.

596
00:33:09,291 --> 00:33:10,916
[Professor] She'll go back to jail,

597
00:33:12,208 --> 00:33:13,750
and we'll keep on digging...

598
00:33:14,708 --> 00:33:17,000
and digging and digging.

599
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:22,083
And between 4:00 and 4:30 in the morning,
we're going to reach the end

600
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,916
of the 11 meters and 68 centimeters
of our tunnel,

601
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,708
which means that we're finally...

602
00:33:28,291 --> 00:33:30,000
getting to the parking garage.

603
00:33:32,125 --> 00:33:34,666
- Questions?
- How do we enter parking

604
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,166
without being seen?

605
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:38,333
Good! Good!

606
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:40,333
A good question. A very good question.

607
00:33:40,416 --> 00:33:42,791
In two stages. First: Pakistan.

608
00:33:42,875 --> 00:33:45,833
- Pakistan.
- That's right. And you'll give the order.

609
00:33:55,625 --> 00:33:57,125
The mole's out for a walk.

610
00:33:58,875 --> 00:33:59,875
Shakir.

611
00:34:00,416 --> 00:34:02,500
- Shakir, now.
- Perfect, Professor.

612
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:05,750
The guys from Pakistan
will switch the video signal

613
00:34:05,833 --> 00:34:07,416
of the internal security's computers,

614
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,916
and from then on, the guards
will only be watching a recording.

615
00:34:14,291 --> 00:34:15,375
Stage two:

616
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Marseille.

617
00:34:17,916 --> 00:34:20,625
Marseille will be at the very peak
of his partying

618
00:34:20,708 --> 00:34:23,583
when all the bars in Madrid have closed,
but...

619
00:34:24,583 --> 00:34:28,000
he'll certainly want to keep dancing
with his new girl,

620
00:34:28,541 --> 00:34:29,541
Sheila.

621
00:34:31,125 --> 00:34:32,125
Marseille.

622
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:33,750
On the line.

623
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:36,250
- Benjamín?
- I'm listening.

624
00:34:36,333 --> 00:34:38,708
That will provide us
with the acoustic cover we need

625
00:34:38,791 --> 00:34:40,250
so they don't hear the grinders.

626
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:41,875
Stopwatches.

627
00:34:46,208 --> 00:34:49,250
Three... two... one.

628
00:34:50,166 --> 00:34:51,166
Now.

629
00:34:53,375 --> 00:34:54,750
Now.

630
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,666
[dance music playing]

631
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:19,875
Good evening.

632
00:35:20,125 --> 00:35:21,250
<i>Is there a problem?</i>

633
00:35:21,666 --> 00:35:23,208
What the fuck are you doing?

634
00:35:23,291 --> 00:35:24,541
[Marseille] <i>A party!</i>

635
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:26,208
They've closed all the bars,

636
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:29,708
so we're having a little party
here in my car, sir.

637
00:35:30,416 --> 00:35:32,708
[Professor] <i>Marseille, keep stalling.</i>

638
00:35:32,791 --> 00:35:34,083
Keep stalling, Marseille.

639
00:35:35,708 --> 00:35:36,791
One minute!

640
00:35:38,625 --> 00:35:42,000
So what kind of party are you two having
with alcohol-free beer?

641
00:35:42,583 --> 00:35:44,833
It's just I wanna make love tonight,

642
00:35:44,916 --> 00:35:47,291
- and with alcohol, ooh...
- [Sheila laughs]

643
00:35:47,375 --> 00:35:50,625
And no alcohol, hmm! [laughs]

644
00:35:50,708 --> 00:35:51,750
Turn off the music.

645
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,250
Benjamín!

646
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:56,375
Thirty seconds!

647
00:35:56,916 --> 00:35:58,750
Don't turn it off, Marseille.

648
00:35:58,833 --> 00:36:00,750
- [Marseille] What?
- Turn off the music.

649
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:04,875
[Benjamín] <i>Twenty seconds!</i>

650
00:36:05,375 --> 00:36:08,875
- Turn off the music!
- [Professor] Keep stalling. Keep stalling.

651
00:36:11,333 --> 00:36:13,083
- [guard] Get out.
- [Professor] <i>Hold on.</i>

652
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,500
[Benjamín] <i>Ten!</i>

653
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,333
- Get out of the car.
- Five!

654
00:36:23,291 --> 00:36:25,125
[Benjamín] <i>The rabbit hole is open.</i>

655
00:36:25,208 --> 00:36:26,250
We're inside.

656
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:29,208
Okay! Okay! Okay, okay, okay!

657
00:36:29,916 --> 00:36:30,791
[music stops]

658
00:36:30,875 --> 00:36:32,083
[guard] Get out of here.

659
00:36:36,583 --> 00:36:38,250
[car engine starts]

660
00:36:55,916 --> 00:36:57,208
We are inside.

661
00:36:57,791 --> 00:36:58,791
Benjamín...

662
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:01,041
<i>stage three.</i>

663
00:37:01,333 --> 00:37:02,333
Roger.

[cell phone ringing]

665
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:13,458
Tell me.

666
00:37:13,541 --> 00:37:14,750
[Raúl] <i>M-607.</i>

[tense music builds]

670
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,250
Eight in the morning
on the second day...

671
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:38,416
we begin the final stage.

672
00:37:39,208 --> 00:37:42,541
<i>At 8 a.m., Lisbon will depart
from Soto del Real prison,</i>

673
00:37:42,625 --> 00:37:45,291
<i>and she'll be transferred
by the same convoy as the day before.</i>

674
00:37:50,375 --> 00:37:51,875
Lisbon just left the prison.

675
00:37:52,583 --> 00:37:53,583
<i>Get ready.</i>

676
00:37:54,625 --> 00:37:55,625
Tokyo,

677
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:57,375
prepare Gandía.

678
00:37:57,583 --> 00:38:00,416
[Professor] <i>At 8:35,
he'll arrive at the Supreme Court,</i>

679
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,208
<i>and the entrance
will still be filled with journalists,</i>

680
00:38:03,291 --> 00:38:05,583
so they'll have to repeat
the same procedure.

681
00:38:06,708 --> 00:38:09,458
<i>They'll get in through the parking garage.</i>

682
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:12,208
<i>But this time, there's a difference.</i>

683
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,125
You guys will already be there,

684
00:38:15,708 --> 00:38:17,458
but no one will be able to see you

685
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,583
because what you'll be doing overnight...

686
00:38:21,208 --> 00:38:23,208
is constructing an entire fake wall.

687
00:38:23,291 --> 00:38:24,875
Oh, my God! That's crazy.

688
00:38:24,958 --> 00:38:28,458
[Professor] <i>After you open the hole,
you'll have three hours to build the wall</i>

689
00:38:28,541 --> 00:38:30,583
<i>before the first employees
at the Supreme Court</i>

690
00:38:30,666 --> 00:38:32,333
<i>arrive at seven in the morning.</i>

691
00:38:34,625 --> 00:38:35,750
Okay. So the wall

692
00:38:35,833 --> 00:38:39,666
<i>has to be small enough
so that no one realizes it's there,</i>

693
00:38:40,583 --> 00:38:43,250
<i>but big enough
so five of you can hide behind it.</i>

694
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,250
Perfect.

695
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:07,083
And now comes
the David Copperfield moment.

696
00:39:07,833 --> 00:39:09,791
How do we extract

697
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:11,875
<i>a person coming out of a van</i>

698
00:39:11,958 --> 00:39:16,416
<i>escorted by six vehicles
and surrounded by police officers</i>

699
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,583
<i>without...</i>

700
00:39:18,208 --> 00:39:19,208
<i>anyone...</i>

701
00:39:19,833 --> 00:39:21,000
realizing?

702
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:24,166
Life has to follow its course
after we do it...

703
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,541
as if nothing had ever happened.

704
00:39:30,541 --> 00:39:33,750
We're going to have to move the next piece
on the board for that,

705
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:38,875
and this piece is fundamental.

706
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:48,916
[Tokyo] Your moment has arrived.

707
00:39:49,916 --> 00:39:51,416
Now you get to choose your own fate.

708
00:39:52,416 --> 00:39:54,541
Life... or death?

709
00:39:55,666 --> 00:39:57,708
We reconnected your little toys,

710
00:39:57,791 --> 00:40:00,875
so you're gonna call the tent,
you'll talk to Tamayo,

711
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:03,500
and you'll tell him you murdered Nairobi.

712
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:06,625
You fucking son of a bitch.

713
00:40:09,583 --> 00:40:11,208
And that you've killed me too.

714
00:40:13,083 --> 00:40:16,625
Also we still haven't found
the panic room, but we're just about to.

715
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:20,291
That you're going out,
and you've got a radio.

716
00:40:21,458 --> 00:40:22,458
What's wrong?

717
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,791
Do I still make you horny, like when
I stuck the grenade shard in you?

718
00:40:30,083 --> 00:40:31,083
Let's go.

719
00:40:44,625 --> 00:40:46,291
[man] <i>This is the command center.</i>

720
00:40:48,833 --> 00:40:50,291
This is César Gandía,

721
00:40:51,208 --> 00:40:54,125
chief of security
for the governor of the Bank of Spain.

722
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:58,809
They've caught me. They're trying
to use me so they can trick you.

723
00:40:58,833 --> 00:40:59,958
It's a trap!

724
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:01,625
[man] <i>Gandía...</i>

725
00:41:02,875 --> 00:41:03,875
it's the Professor.

726
00:41:05,416 --> 00:41:07,056
<i>We knew perfectly well you would do this,</i>

727
00:41:07,083 --> 00:41:10,083
<i>but remember, this was
your only opportunity to get it wrong.</i>

728
00:41:10,791 --> 00:41:12,666
<i>The next call is directly to Tamayo,</i>

729
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:15,541
<i>- and if you make the same mistake...</i>
- Think about your son Juanito.

730
00:41:16,875 --> 00:41:18,208
<i>...Tokyo will execute you.</i>

731
00:41:19,375 --> 00:41:20,375
You heard that, Tokyo?

732
00:41:20,875 --> 00:41:23,500
- Loud and clear.
- [Professor] <i>Listen to me, Tokyo.</i>

733
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:25,416
You'll hang up...

734
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:28,750
and you'll kill him.

735
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,250
<i>So I want you to understand
one thing, Gandía.</i>

736
00:41:32,333 --> 00:41:35,750
<i>You can't win anymore.
You've already lost. Do you understand?</i>

737
00:41:35,833 --> 00:41:39,208
The only heroic thing you can do
is see your wife and son again.

738
00:41:40,333 --> 00:41:41,750
<i>Otherwise, they'll lose you.</i>

739
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:44,375
They'll lose you.

740
00:41:45,916 --> 00:41:47,083
<i>Understood, Tokyo?</i>

741
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,500
Let's go.

742
00:42:00,375 --> 00:42:03,041
[phone ringing]

743
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:05,750
Suarez.

744
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:08,291
Martínez!

745
00:42:09,958 --> 00:42:10,791
Colonel!

746
00:42:10,875 --> 00:42:11,916
We have Gandía.

747
00:42:13,166 --> 00:42:14,458
Gandía, talk to me.

748
00:42:15,041 --> 00:42:17,041
Colonel, I'm in the panic room.

749
00:42:17,916 --> 00:42:19,833
They're about to discover it.

750
00:42:19,916 --> 00:42:22,083
I've eliminated Nairobi and Tokyo.

751
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:24,750
<i>I'm going on another attack.</i>

752
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:27,333
I'll take a radio.
I'll give you the frequency.

753
00:42:29,083 --> 00:42:30,750
Suarez, I want all units ready to go.

754
00:42:30,833 --> 00:42:32,625
Units alpha and beta, get in position.

755
00:42:32,708 --> 00:42:34,125
<i>I want everyone on alert.</i>

756
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,083
[Gandía] 462.662.

757
00:42:47,708 --> 00:42:48,708
Time to go.

758
00:42:50,916 --> 00:42:53,750
If we can't kidnap Lisbon when
she gets there, what should we do?

759
00:42:53,833 --> 00:42:55,593
Wait in the wall
until she's done testifying?

760
00:42:55,666 --> 00:42:58,666
This time Lisbon won't take more
than 20 minutes

761
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:00,458
to get back to the parking garage.

762
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:05,333
<i>They'll object. Of course they'll object,
but she'll be within her rights.</i>

763
00:43:07,916 --> 00:43:09,916
I've decided against testifying.

764
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:13,666
Mrs. Murillo,
you incriminated yourself yesterday.

765
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:15,791
I advise you to still cooperate.

766
00:43:16,333 --> 00:43:18,708
There could be benefits for you doing so.

767
00:43:19,541 --> 00:43:22,581
So the judge will be forced to give
an early sentence and send her to prison,

768
00:43:22,625 --> 00:43:24,416
and the same men who brought her in

769
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,625
will return to the parking garage
with her.

770
00:43:27,541 --> 00:43:29,458
But this time, no one will be watching

771
00:43:29,541 --> 00:43:31,083
<i>because the security guards</i>

772
00:43:31,166 --> 00:43:33,875
<i>will be looking at the recording
from the previous night.</i>

773
00:43:37,833 --> 00:43:41,166
<i>They'll watch Lisbon's first arrival,
and then...</i>

774
00:43:41,583 --> 00:43:43,041
they'll cross paths with...

775
00:43:44,041 --> 00:43:45,041
a judge...

776
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,625
a prosecutor...

777
00:43:49,666 --> 00:43:51,208
a police officer...

778
00:43:51,791 --> 00:43:53,291
and two lawyers.

779
00:43:55,916 --> 00:43:58,125
Okay, maybe it's better
if you're a prisoner.

780
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:02,250
Benjamín.

781
00:44:03,083 --> 00:44:05,125
- Everyone ready?
- We're prepared.

782
00:44:09,208 --> 00:44:10,416
Now.

783
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,500
[tense music playing]

784
00:44:20,833 --> 00:44:23,000
- [Professor] <i>Benjamín.</i>
- I see her.

785
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:30,208
Twenty-five meters.

786
00:44:35,833 --> 00:44:37,083
Ten meters.

787
00:44:41,583 --> 00:44:42,791
The signal will be...

788
00:44:45,833 --> 00:44:46,833
"Good morning."

789
00:44:46,916 --> 00:44:47,916
Three meters.

790
00:44:49,958 --> 00:44:51,000
Good morning.

791
00:44:55,041 --> 00:44:56,041
[shouting]

792
00:45:06,708 --> 00:45:07,958
Good morning, Ms. Lisbon.

793
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,500
Hi.

794
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:11,333
Let's go.

795
00:45:11,666 --> 00:45:15,083
We're going to complicate their lives
a bit because in 45 seconds

796
00:45:15,166 --> 00:45:17,646
<i>we'll make them wear belts
with explosives around their chests.</i>

797
00:45:17,708 --> 00:45:21,500
<i>In 55, we'll have two cameras
and two microphones monitor them</i>

798
00:45:21,583 --> 00:45:22,583
<i>so that...</i>

799
00:45:25,333 --> 00:45:27,416
if they decide to change the route...

800
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:28,500
Boom!

801
00:45:29,333 --> 00:45:31,708
If they give
even the slightest sign of alarm...

802
00:45:32,291 --> 00:45:33,291
Boom!

803
00:45:33,333 --> 00:45:36,500
[Darko] If you don't bring the prisoner
to the prison...

804
00:45:36,583 --> 00:45:37,583
Boom!

805
00:45:39,791 --> 00:45:42,041
Wait, we're the ones
taking the prisoner, no?

806
00:45:42,541 --> 00:45:44,541
We're going to give them another Lisbon.

807
00:45:46,666 --> 00:45:48,458
[tense music continues]

808
00:45:59,125 --> 00:46:00,125
Convoy unit.

809
00:46:01,791 --> 00:46:03,291
[officer] <i>Everything okay down there?</i>

810
00:46:03,375 --> 00:46:04,583
You're taking too long.

811
00:46:07,041 --> 00:46:08,916
Yeah, yeah. Everything's fine.

812
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:11,750
- We're on our way.
- [officer] <i>Okay, okay. Got it.</i>

813
00:46:13,875 --> 00:46:14,958
[Professor] <i>And that...</i>

814
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,333
<i>is when our greatest illusion begins.
Our David Copperfield moment.</i>

815
00:46:20,416 --> 00:46:22,851
- [Benjamín] Who's this guy Copperfield?
- [Darko] The magician.

816
00:46:22,875 --> 00:46:24,041
Magician? Like Harry Potter?

817
00:46:24,125 --> 00:46:26,208
It'll look like everything's the same.

818
00:46:32,666 --> 00:46:34,041
But it won't be.

819
00:46:38,541 --> 00:46:39,541
<i>Because at that moment,</i>

820
00:46:39,583 --> 00:46:42,458
<i>Lisbon will be crawling at full speed
through the tunnel we dug.</i>

821
00:47:01,208 --> 00:47:02,208
Come on.

822
00:47:08,041 --> 00:47:09,041
Come on.

823
00:47:50,916 --> 00:47:52,583
[horns blaring]

824
00:48:17,291 --> 00:48:18,291
Here we go.

825
00:48:24,541 --> 00:48:25,541
Tokyo...

826
00:48:26,291 --> 00:48:27,291
<i>Lisbon's on her way.</i>

827
00:48:27,875 --> 00:48:29,875
<i>Start the countdown... now.</i>

828
00:48:32,083 --> 00:48:33,083
Start running!

829
00:48:34,916 --> 00:48:36,541
Colonel, they opened fire!

830
00:48:37,958 --> 00:48:38,958
Gandía!

831
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,208
- <i>Gandía, respond!</i>
- "I'm here."

832
00:48:41,291 --> 00:48:42,583
I'm here!

833
00:48:43,208 --> 00:48:45,851
- [Tokyo] "They're closing in on me."
- They're closing in on me, sir.

834
00:48:45,875 --> 00:48:48,750
- I'm caught in the fucking cross fire!
- [Tokyo] Very good.

835
00:48:49,708 --> 00:48:50,708
Going up.

836
00:48:53,041 --> 00:48:54,921
What's your position?
Can we give covering fire?

837
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,125
[Tokyo] "Negative."

838
00:48:56,208 --> 00:48:57,541
[Gandía] <i>Negative, Colonel.</i>

839
00:48:57,625 --> 00:49:00,041
- [Tokyo] "Heading to the roof."
- Heading to the roof, sir.

840
00:49:00,541 --> 00:49:03,333
- [Tokyo] "Requesting immediate evac."
- Requesting immediate evac!

841
00:49:03,416 --> 00:49:05,750
Suarez, for Christ's sake,
send a fucking helicopter now.

842
00:49:05,833 --> 00:49:07,875
- Let's go!
- Delta 1, get ready for takeoff.

843
00:49:07,958 --> 00:49:10,000
Rescue operation
at the Bank of Spain now.

844
00:49:11,875 --> 00:49:13,208
Hang in there, Gandía.

845
00:49:13,291 --> 00:49:15,166
I have an M16 and three cartridges.

846
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:17,625
<i>I don't know how much longer I can last!</i>

847
00:49:18,791 --> 00:49:19,958
Fire. Now.

848
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:31,333
- "They've started a fire."
- They've started a fire.

849
00:49:31,416 --> 00:49:32,958
<i>I can't see anything!</i>

850
00:49:33,041 --> 00:49:34,333
[Ángel] Colonel. Colonel!

851
00:49:34,416 --> 00:49:36,096
[officer] <i>Smoke's coming through the roof.</i>

852
00:49:36,166 --> 00:49:38,333
Hang on there, Gandía.
The helicopter's on its way.

853
00:49:53,666 --> 00:49:55,291
- Lisbon.
- Marseille.

854
00:49:55,375 --> 00:49:56,500
Marseille.

855
00:49:57,125 --> 00:49:58,625
Professor, we have Lisbon.

856
00:49:59,291 --> 00:50:00,333
Blue ammo clips.

857
00:50:12,666 --> 00:50:13,666
Let's go!

858
00:50:27,208 --> 00:50:29,833
[Benjamín] <i>How are we gonna get
the military helicopter?</i>

859
00:50:30,791 --> 00:50:32,125
[Professor] <i>The same place</i>

860
00:50:32,208 --> 00:50:34,848
we got the vehicles we used
to get into the bank: the black market.

861
00:50:35,208 --> 00:50:38,500
And not just that, we're going
to intercept their communications

862
00:50:38,583 --> 00:50:40,666
so that when they wanna talk
to their own chopper,

863
00:50:41,125 --> 00:50:43,166
we're the ones that are going to answer.

864
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,166
[Tamayo]
<i>Where is that helicopter?</i>

865
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:47,500
Delta unit, position.

866
00:50:48,083 --> 00:50:48,916
Time?

867
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,750
Two minutes, fifty seconds.

868
00:50:50,833 --> 00:50:52,541
Two minutes, fifty seconds, sir.

869
00:50:52,625 --> 00:50:54,500
Get up to the roof. We'll cover you.

870
00:50:54,583 --> 00:50:57,416
Impossible!
There's plastic explosive on the door.

871
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:00,750
- Fuck! Where's the bomb expert?
- We need a bomb expert!

872
00:51:02,458 --> 00:51:03,875
Gandía, describe the device.

873
00:51:03,958 --> 00:51:05,333
"Blue wire to the starter."

874
00:51:05,416 --> 00:51:08,666
There's a motion sensor,
a blue wire, to the starter.

875
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,291
Cut it. That's a basic bomb device.

876
00:51:16,375 --> 00:51:17,375
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

877
00:51:17,416 --> 00:51:18,656
- [Ángel] No!
- [Tamayo] Cut it.

878
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:20,041
No, Colonel. Colonel!

879
00:51:22,958 --> 00:51:24,333
"I've cut the wire."

880
00:51:24,416 --> 00:51:26,041
I've cut the wire.

881
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:27,375
Denver, now.

882
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,400
- [Bogotá] Go, go, go!
- "I'm wearing black. Hold your fire."

883
00:51:30,458 --> 00:51:31,666
I'm exiting now.

884
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:34,208
I have a mask and I'm dressed in black.
Hold your fire!

885
00:51:36,625 --> 00:51:38,305
Our man's dressed in black.
Give him cover.

886
00:51:38,333 --> 00:51:40,958
- [Suarez] <i>Be ready for cross fire.</i>
- [man] <i>Roger.</i>

887
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:46,458
[Professor] <i>Blue ammo clips.</i>

888
00:51:46,958 --> 00:51:47,958
Now!

889
00:51:48,791 --> 00:51:50,166
Go, go, go, go!

890
00:51:50,916 --> 00:51:52,041
[shots fired]

891
00:51:53,833 --> 00:51:55,753
[Ángel] They're on the roof.
They've opened fire!

892
00:51:59,666 --> 00:52:01,583
We need cover fire!

893
00:52:01,666 --> 00:52:03,506
[man] <i>I can't see them.
There's too much smoke.</i>

894
00:52:05,791 --> 00:52:07,541
- [Professor] <i>Tokyo, now.</i>
- Palermo...

895
00:52:09,833 --> 00:52:10,833
[Tokyo] Open it.

896
00:52:13,166 --> 00:52:14,958
[tense dramatic music continues]

897
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,392
- [man 1] <i>Searching for target.</i>
- [man 2] <i>Got a visual.</i>

898
00:52:30,416 --> 00:52:31,583
[man 1] <i>I can see them!</i>

899
00:52:31,666 --> 00:52:32,666
[shots fired]

900
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:34,666
[man] <i>I repeat, I've got a visual.</i>

901
00:52:37,291 --> 00:52:38,500
<i>Permission to fire, sir.</i>

902
00:52:39,291 --> 00:52:40,500
<i>Permission to fire, sir.</i>

903
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:43,875
- [man] <i>Don't shoot!</i>
- Those motherfuckers.

904
00:52:44,416 --> 00:52:45,250
[man] <i>We're exposed.</i>

905
00:52:45,333 --> 00:52:47,333
- They're completely exposed!
- [man] <i>Taking cover!</i>

906
00:52:47,416 --> 00:52:49,166
[man 2] <i>We're taking cover, sir.</i>

907
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:53,333
Delta unit, begin approaching our target.
Rescue protocol.

908
00:52:53,416 --> 00:52:55,416
I want the extraction
to be quick and clean.

Marseille.

910
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,916
Arriving. Helicopter in position, sir.

911
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,791
Get them out of there, for fuck's sake!

912
00:53:09,875 --> 00:53:11,708
Okay, Delta 1. Get in there.

913
00:53:21,541 --> 00:53:24,041
- [Lisbon] Permission to descend, sir!
- Go ahead.

914
00:53:32,666 --> 00:53:34,458
Fall back to the helicopter now!

915

Package delivered, Professor.

920
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,375
I'm out in two minutes.

921
00:54:02,875 --> 00:54:04,750
Where is the helicopter going?

922
00:54:05,833 --> 00:54:07,000
Delta 1, what happened?

923
00:54:07,083 --> 00:54:09,041
<i>Delta 1, return to your position!</i>

924
00:54:09,125 --> 00:54:10,708
- Delta 1, come in!
- Goddamn it!

925
00:54:19,541 --> 00:54:22,875
There's a problem with the helicopter.
We're going in!

926
00:54:26,875 --> 00:54:29,083
Where did that agent come from?
She's insane!

927
00:54:39,708 --> 00:54:41,541
[Lisbon] Colonel, they're pulling back!

[Gandía grunts]

929
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:50,500

Yes?

932
00:54:56,333 --> 00:54:57,541
What?

933
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:01,790
They're calling from Soto del Real.
It's the convoy that transferred Murillo.

934
00:55:02,166 --> 00:55:04,625
Colonel Tamayo? There's a woman
claiming she was kidnapped

935
00:55:04,708 --> 00:55:05,828
on her way out of the salon.

936
00:55:05,875 --> 00:55:09,416
What do I care, idiot?
This is the command center for the heist!

937
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:10,750
Take it, you moron.

938
00:55:11,541 --> 00:55:13,083

- What?
- Colonel.

943
00:55:26,166 --> 00:55:29,291
